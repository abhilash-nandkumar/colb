# colb

A [colcon](https://colcon.readthedocs.io/en/released/) wrapper that makes building and testing single packages more convenient during development.

## Overview

While working on package, one typically performs the following steps:

1. Build all the dependent packages
2. Make some changes
3. Rebuild the package
4. Run the tests

This usually requires multiple colcon invocations.
With this tool, it is enough to run:


```
colb test -r my_package
```

## Examples

To get an overview over the available options:

```
colb help
colb help <verb>
```

Rebuilding just the current package:

```
colb build -s my_package
```

Building and running only a single unit test (only works after the package has been built once):

```
colb test my_package --test my_unit_test
```

To minimize the steps involved in getting a test output, this will directly invoke `ninja` and `ctest`.

If the current directory is already somewhere inside a package, the package name may be omitted from the command line:

```
cd my_ws/src/my_repo/my_package/src
colb build
```

## Requirements

The invoced commands make use of the `colcon-common-extensions` and [colcon mixins](https://github.com/colcon/colcon-mixin-repository) by default, so they should be installed.
By default, the `ccache`, `ninja` and `mold` mixins are enabled, so the associated programs should be installed.

## Configuration

It is possible to customize the options used for the dependency build and for the active package.
The default settings can be written to a `.colb.toml` file using the `colb init` command.
Further invocations will then load the options from this file, which also doubles as a workspace root marker.
